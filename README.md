# Aquamarine

*WIP*

This is my attempt to create an accessible color scheme for a terminal I use, [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/).

## Accessible how?

Contrast, mostly. I just took base colors (blue, red, purple, etc.) and adjusted them using [ColorShark](https://colorshark.io).

## What about color blindness?

I am color blind, but there are too many versions, so one scheme will not work for everyone. I have adjusted color pairs that give me trouble (yellow/green, cyan/white, etc.), which should work for some people.

## Why Aquamarine?

This is one of the colors I changed significantly to get away from white and light gray. Otherwise it should be cyan. Then in [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), which I use, you type with that color, so it felt as good a name as any.
